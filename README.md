# Bacterial-Genome-QC-and-Filtering-Pipeline
This repository contains scripts and workflows for (QC) and filtering of bacterial (WGS) data. It is designed to process raw Illumina sequencing reads, perform quality assessment using FastQC, MultiQC, and fastp/Trimmomatic, trim low-quality bases and adapter sequences, and produce high-quality reads ready for downstream analyses.
