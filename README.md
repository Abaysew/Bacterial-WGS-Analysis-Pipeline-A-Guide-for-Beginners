# Bacterial Genome QC, Filtering, Alignment, Variant Calling & Phylogenetic Analysis Pipeline for Beginners
This repository contains scripts and workflows for end-to-end analysis of bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, from quality control (QC) to phylogenetic analysis. It is designed to process raw paired-end Illumina sequencing reads and perform analyses using a variety of bioinformatics tools.
